      <h6>I wandered lonely as a cloud</h6>
<h6>by <em>William Wordsworth</em></h6>
<h6>I wandered <strong>lonely</strong> as a cloud</h6>
<h5>That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</h5>
<h5>When all at once I saw a crowd,</h5>
<h5>A host, of golden daffodils;</h5>
<h4>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</h4>
<h4>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</h4>
<h4>Continuous as the stars that shine</h4>
<h4>And twinkle on the milky way,</h4>
<h3>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</h3>
<h3>They stretched in never-ending line</h3>
<h3>Along the margin of a bay:</h3>
<h2>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</h2>
<h2>Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</h2>
<h2>The waves beside them danced, but they</h2>
<h2>Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;</h2>
<h1>A poet could not be but gay,</h1>
<h1>In such a jocund company!</h1>
<h1>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</h1>
<h6>What wealth the show to me had brought:</h6>
<h2>For oft, when on my couch I lie</h2>
<h3>In vacant or in pensive mood,</h3>
<h4>They flash upon that inward eye</h4>
<h5>Which is the bliss of solitude;</h5>
<h2>And then my heart with pleasure fills,</h2>
<h6>And dances with the daffodils.</h6>
